This is a coursework I had in the second year of university. It consisted in designing and implementing a domain specific programming language with the expressive power of conjunctive queries in Haskell (used Alex and Happy for lexing and parsing) and then solving 10 problems with the language I created. The syntax and the capabilities of the language are described in the User Manual and the problems are written in the Problems part 1 and part 2 files, with part 1 having a more detailed description of the requirements.
